Wirehead is an AC: Antitech Collective. Antitech is a return to the early values of tech. Unlike Tech, Antitech values:
1. Technology, defined as good code.
2. Intelligent Actors, defined as the creators of good code.
3. Hard Work, defined as the process by which good code is created.
4. The San Francisco Bay Area, defined as the self-selecting epicenter of human innovation.
